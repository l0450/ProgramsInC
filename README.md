# ProgramsInC #
This repository presents a group of programs written in the C language during my studies in the Automation & Robotics course. All the classes, functions, variables, and comments are in Polish, but in this README.md file, I will explain all the programs in English. The course name is "Introduction to Programming." 

## Exercise 1 - Short multiplication formula ##

Based on the fundamental algorithmic problems, create a program in C that solves the following shortened multiplication formulas:

## Exercise 2 - Tax calculator ##

Write a simple tax calculator program in C. The program should ask the user to enter their annual income and then calculate the tax amount according to a simple taxation system:

* If the annual income is less than 50000 PLN, the tax is 10%
* If the annual income is between 50000 PLN and 100000 PLN, the tax is 15%
* If the annual income is bigger than 100000 PLN, the tax is 20%

The result is the amount of tax that the user has to pay based on the provided annual income.

## Exercise 3 - Sum of numbers in an array ##

Write a program that calculates the sum of the elements of an array using a recursive function.
