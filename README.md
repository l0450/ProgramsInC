# ProgramsInC #
This repository presents a group of programs written in the C language during my studies in the Automation &amp; Robotics course. All the classes, functions, variables, and comments are in Polish, but in this README.md file, I am going to explain all the programs in English. The name of the course is "Introduction to programming".
